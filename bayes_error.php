		<h2>Woops! Looks like something has gone horribly wrong!</h2>
		<p>Maybe you cheated.
		Maybe you tried to access a forbidden page. 
		Maybe you stayed very still for so long that the server forgot all about you.
		Or maybe it's just bad programming on my part.<p>
		<h2>Don't worry though!</h2> 
		<p>No information has been lost. Just reload the game from the intro page and everything should be back to normal.</p>
		<p>Probably.</p>
		<p>Yeah.</p>
